## Write Surface Registries Boundary

Three registries describe write paths from different angles:

| Registry | View | When to update |
|----------|------|----------------|
| `omo-governance-surfaces.yaml` | Architectural/top-down: which planes/assets exist and who may write them | New asset or plane added |
| `mutation-surfaces.yaml` | Operational/bottom-up: which CLI entrypoints perform brokered writes | New broker write command added |
| `internal-write-profiles.yaml` | Runtime/worker: which worker-internal paths are permitted | New worker write path added |

## Rule

Registry records are evidence for discovery and binding. They do not authorize live mutation or external installation.
