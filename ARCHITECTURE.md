## 2. Layer Model

Layer names and project placement are owned by [`docs/project-registry.yaml`](docs/project-registry.yaml) and generated into [`docs/generated/project-layer-index.md`](docs/generated/project-layer-index.md).

The stable dependency direction remains:

```text
entry surfaces -> routing mesh -> engines/runtime/protocol -> governed state and evidence
```

External resources enter through the same direction:

```text
external descriptor -> sandbox/admission -> Agora route -> Workflow Mesh execution
                    -> OMO evidence -> Kairon/KOS/gbrain derived memory
```

Workflow execution has one control-plane fact source:

```text
admission -> StepDispatched -> worker ACK/lease -> timeout/reclaim -> evidence/verification
                         \-> OMO append-only events and projections
```

Worker YAML dispatch artifacts, runtime logs and handoff notes are derived
operational materials. They may explain or recover an execution, but they do
not advance WorkflowRun state without the corresponding OMO event.

## 3. Entry Architecture

| Audience | Preferred Entry | Contract |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| Human operator | `cockpit` CLI/Web | One human-facing entry surface |
| AI agent | `agora` MCP via `bos://` URI | Cross-layer calls go through the mesh |
| Governance automation | `omo` CLI/MCP broker | Governed state mutations are audited |
| Web/API consumers | cockpit-mounted HTTP surfaces | Public web entry remains converged at L3 |
| Knowledge write (card PUT) | `cockpit /api/knowledge/put` → EventBus → `KnowledgeIndexer` | L3 网络优先解析 + 写后事件广播 (ADR-0294) |

Do not introduce a new top-level human or agent entry without updating the relevant registry, boundary documentation, and governance checks.

## 4. BOS URI Domains

| Domain | URI Prefix | Role |
|--------|------------|------|
| Memory | `bos://memory/` | Knowledge, facts, search, storage |
| Governance | `bos://governance/` | OMO, policy, task/debt/audit flows |
| Analysis | `bos://analysis/` | Research, ontology derivation, code analysis |
| Persona | `bos://persona/` | Persona and personal knowledge bridges |
| Capability | `bos://capability/` | Tools, runtime capabilities, execution surfaces |

The complete machine-readable service map is [`projects/agora/etc/bos-services.yaml`](projects/agora/etc/bos-services.yaml). Markdown should reference that file rather than duplicating service counts or route inventories.

### 4.1 External Connection Fabric

External knowledge, data, resources, methods, tools, models and channels share one descriptor and
lifecycle contract. The fabric is a cross-cutting capability, not a new top-level project:

| Responsibility | Owner |
|---|---|
| Descriptor and protocol contract | ECOS |
| Scene-bound admission, approval and evidence | OMO |
| Discovery and capability routing | Agora (`agora.external_connections`) |
| Knowledge source adapters | Kairon / Iris |
| Method compilation and evaluation | Kairon / Sophia |
| Execution, delivery receipts and recovery | Runtime / Workflow Mesh |
| Model, credentials, quota and cost | AetherForge |
| Human connection catalog and visibility | Cockpit |

The machine-readable contract is [`external-connection-fabric.yaml`](.omo/_truth/registry/external-connection-fabric.yaml).
Credentials are referenced, never stored in descriptors; unavailable or stale resources must remain
visible as such and must not be projected as successful live state.
Runtime discovery uses the `external.resources` entry-point group; Agora returns a credential-free
receipt that can be appended as OMO `EvidenceRecorded` without owning workflow state.

## 5. Governance Surfaces

```
.omo/                 -> state plane: goals, state, evidence, tasks, audits
projects/omo/         -> kernel plane: schemas, brokers, audit/lint/sync logic
projects/c2g/         -> ingress plane: strategy/pitch-to-task materialization
projects/ecos/        -> protocol plane: MOF and L0 constraints
```

Rules:

- `.omo/` is data and evidence, not a place for new long-lived execution logic.
- State mutations should use OMO CLI/MCP, C2G ingress, or registered brokers.
- New governance surfaces require runtime behavior, registry entries, and validation gates. Documentation alone is not implementation.
- External capabilities require a registered descriptor, scene binding, health evidence, and a reversible lifecycle before activation.
- Worker execution requires a durable dispatch context, ACK/lease evidence and an explicit reclaim path; a generated packet is not completion evidence.
- Direct `.omo/` or `spaces/` writes are violations unless routed through an approved audited path.

## 6. Port Registry & Transport (P77/P78)

```
protocols/port-registry.yaml  — I0 SSOT (name, transport, status, env_var)
projects/ecos/port-registry.yaml  — L0 mirror (aligned to I0)
```

- Every service port **must** be registered in `protocols/port-registry.yaml` with `name`, `transport` (stdio/http/sse/udp), and `status` (active/deprecated/reserved).
- Ports should be referenced via `{SERVICE}_PORT` env var, not literals (P77-7 env-var-SSOT).
- Deprecated ports (8765/9090) retain entry for historical resolution but `status: deprecated`.
- Foundry v2: port-governance deck validates hardcoded ports on every 6h cron cycle.

## 7. Core Flows

```
user or agent -> cockpit or agora -> bos:// route -> target service -> audited response or state transition
external or local source -> kairon ingestion/schema/search -> gbrain or local substrate -> retrieval
intent or pitch -> c2g or OMO broker -> task/debt/audit registry -> validation -> evidence
service definition -> runtime scheduler/matrix/sandbox -> health observation -> governance alert or recovery
external resource -> descriptor -> scene-bound admission -> capability route -> receipt/evidence -> derived memory
```
