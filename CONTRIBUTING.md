# Contributing to runtime

Thank you for considering a contribution! This guide covers the development workflow, commit conventions, and review process for **runtime**.

## Development Environment

- **Stack**: Python (uv, pytest)
- **Python requirement**: see [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) (if applicable)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest "tests/" -q

# Run lint
uv run ruff check "src/"

# Format code
make fmt
```

## Commit Convention

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat(scope):` — New feature
- `fix(scope):` — Bug fix
- `refactor(scope):` — Code refactoring
- `docs(scope):` — Documentation
- `test(scope):` — Tests
- `chore(scope):` — Maintenance

## Code Standards

- Keep changes focused and scoped to one concern per PR.
- Add or update tests for new behavior.
- Ensure the lint/test commands above pass before requesting review.

## Project-Specific Notes

- KEI sandbox isolation is a security boundary; never weaken sandbox defaults without an ADR.
- Run `make sync-state` after state schema changes and commit generated state if the Makefile requires it.

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make changes following the conventions above.
3. Run the project's test and lint commands.
4. Submit a PR with a clear description of the change and its motivation.
